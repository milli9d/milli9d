# 😄 Fun fact: 
 
It was in 1947 that the first case of a computer bug was recorded. 

Grace Hopper, an admiral in the US Navy, was working on a Mark II computer when she discovered a moth had become stuck in the relay, thus causing it to malfunction.

Once the moth was removed, she wrote in her journal “first actual case of bug being found” – and the rest is history.
